/// \brief Static class which allows creating a singleton in a thread safe manner.
///
/// The potential issues associated with creating singletons in a multithreaded context is described in Ticket-247205.
/// The root cause appears to be a compiler bug in gcc (which is not present in clang):
///   https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=99613/
///
/// The issue is summarised here:
///
/// Constructing static objects:
///   The standard states that, in the context of initializing a static variable, "If control enters the declaration
///   concurrently while the variable is being initialized, the concurrent execution shall wait for completion of the
///   initialization." (Ref: https://eel.is/c++draft/stmt.dcl#3).
///
/// Destruction sequence of static objects:
///   The standard guarantees (paraphrased to omit the lawyer language) that if a static object is created before
///   another static object, then the second object will be destroyed before the first. (Ref:
///   https://eel.is/c++draft/basic.start.term#4)
///
/// Based on these two points, we consider the following case:
///   Thread A tries to initialize static object X and then static object Y.
///   Thread B tries to initialize static object X.
///
/// There are 3 possible sequences of interest:
///  1. Thread A initializes X, Thread A initializes Y, Thread B reads X.
///  2. Thread A initializes X, Thread B tries to initialize X but it's already being initialized by thread A so it
///  waits for thread A to finish, Thread A initializes Y.
///  3. Thread B initializes X, Thread A tries to initialize X but it's already being initialized by thread B so it
///  waits for thread B to finish, Thread A initializes Y.
///
/// In all these cases, from the perspective of both threads, X was initialized before Y and therefore Y should be
/// destroyed before X. However, in practice, we see that sometimes although both threads see that X was initialized
/// before Y, X is still destroyed before Y. This can lead to a crash if Y relies on X in its destruction sequence.
///
/// Workaround:
///
/// Atomic operations tagged memory_order_seq_cst (default) order memory such that everything that happened-before a
/// store in one thread becomes a visible side effect in the thread that did a load. (Ref:
/// https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/atomic/memory_order.html) This means that memory / operations cannot be reordered
/// around the atomic load. I.e. if X is initialized before the atomic load and Y is constructed after the atomic
/// load, then the creation order of these two cannot be reordered.
///
/// We therefore store an atomic pointer to the static object which is loaded by any thread which wants to access the
/// static object, creating a compiler barrier / fence which prevents reordering.
