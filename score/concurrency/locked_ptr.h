/**
 * @brief RAII smart pointer that allows for thread-safe access to an object guarded by a lock.
 *        The Lock is held during the lifetime of LockedPtr. On destruction, lock is destroyed which would release the
 * lock. LockedPtr provides pointer-like semantics (operator*, operator->) to access the underlying object.
 *        Additionally, LockedPtr provides an unlock_guard() method that returns an UnlockGuard which can be used to
 * temporarily unlock the Lock while ensuring it gets locked again when the UnlockGuard goes out of scope.
 *
 * @tparam T Type of the object being pointed to.
 * @tparam Lock Type of the lock that manages access to the object. Must satisfy the BasicLockable concept.
 *
 * @details
 * LockedPtr is a smart pointer that combines a raw pointer to an object of type T and a lock of type Lock.
 * The LockedPtr ensures thread-safe access to the pointed-to object.
 *
 * Usage:
 * @code
 * std::mutex m;
 * SomeType obj;
 *
 * {
 *     LockedPtr locked_ptr(&obj, std::unique_lock(m));
 *     // Access obj through locked_ptr while the lock is held
 *     locked_ptr->some_method();
 * } // lock is released when locked_ptr goes out of scope
 * @endcode
